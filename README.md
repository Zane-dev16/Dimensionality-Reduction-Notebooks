# Dimensionality-Reduction-Notebooks

This repository houses several notebooks that tackle the challenge of reducing high-dimensional linear datasetsl, the mnist dataset and unrolling the swiss roll.
The swiss roll is a classic dimensionality reduction problem. 

For more about the mnist dataset refer to [https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=554&status=active](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=554&status=active)


For more about the swiss roll refer to [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/manifold/plot_swissroll.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/manifold/plot_swissroll.html)

## Notebook Categories

The following notebooks can be found in the `notebooks/` directory:

- **linear_data_dim_reduction.ipynb**: We take several approaches with PCA and Random Projection to reduce the dimensionality of a high dimensional linear dataset and the MNIST data set
- **swiss_roll.ipynb**: We utilize several techniques LLE, MDS, ISOMAP and t-SNE to attempt to unroll the swiss roll

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Zane-dev16/Dimensionality-Reduction-Notebooks.git
    ```
2. Run the notebooks in your preferred order on any compatible platform
